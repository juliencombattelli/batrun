# How to contribute

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to batrun](https://github.com/juliencombattelli/batrun/pull/new/main)
with a clear list of what is done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
When you send a pull request, please update the internal validation test suite
accordingly. Please follow the coding conventions below and make sure all of
your commits are atomic (one feature per commit) to make the review easier.

Always write a clear message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for
small changes, but bigger changes should add some details in the commit
description.
